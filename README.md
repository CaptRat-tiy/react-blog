The blog display needs a header, main content area, and footer.

Main content area needs to have a main area for actual content and at least one sidebar.

Site also needs a navigation bar that takes users to blog posts, an about page, and a recommended links links page.

The blog posts should include a date-time entry and tags.

The sidebar should include a list of months when a blog entry has been made, along with a list of tags used on blogs. Clicking on a month or tag should show a filtered list of blog entries.
